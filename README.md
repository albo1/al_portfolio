# al_portfolio

## A Portfolio I made containing some of my most recent projects

## I wanted to create a proffessional portfolio (or as close to one as I could get) so that I can be better prepared for job hunting in the industry.

## This has helped me better understand CSS and advanced CSS concepts.
